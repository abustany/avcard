# AVCard

... that stands for Android VCard importer.

As silly as it may sound, I haven't found a single VCard importer for Android
that was able to go through my set of VCards (yes, they have non-ASCII
characters, non-European languages, etc.). Luckily, the people from the
[CardMe](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cardme/) have done an excellent job,
and their library went through all my VCards without a hitch. The remaining
step was to wrap it in a trivial Android app, and AVCard is the result.

## Features

* Import a folder of VCF files in your address book
* Speaks English, French and Spanish
* Yes, that's all

**WARNING: The UI is awfully basic, and error reporting is limited at best.
The app will not delete your contacts, but it won't do any merging either.**

## Bugs, feature requests, etc.

You can use GitHub issues for that.

## Why isn't the app on the Play Store?

Because I didn't feel like forking out 25 bucks to Google for that.
